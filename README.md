## Description
This website is a starter portfolio for me to build on or even recreate later in the future once I have the tools and the knowledge to do so. When you first enter the site you will be presented with my name and the content of the page. To the top right of the page is a navigation bar that can be clicked to take the user to the corresponding section on the page. As of right now I do have a resume navigation that at the moment isn't functional seeing as I do not yet have a resume to upload just yet. Also I did adjust for two different screen sizes giving 3 different screen size looks if you include the normal desktop look. Also under projects is a list of my projects, these images are clickable and will direct the user to my projects websites to further view if they choose. This web application is a responsive web application and will adjust to different screen sizes. Also if you go to the contact section and click on the word GitHub it will take you to my GitHub profile on GitHub.

## User Story
